About Us

The creator of rpgalot, a 22 year old CS/English major who is known 
for being quite forgetful, found herself often invited for a D&D session
only to discover that she left her character sheet back in her dorm room
over an hour away.

That's where rpgalot came in.  No longer do gamers have to worry about having
all their character sheets on hand, or wondering which character goes to
which game.  rpgalot is an online database to store all your charactersheets,
which you can later print off when it's time to game, then update your new stats
to the database. 





How was RPGalot built?

Sarah, currently the only person working on this web application, made it using a php 
backbone on her Mac computer in whatever free time she had inbetween classes and homework 
assignments.  Most of the art was sketched halfheartedly on a scrap piece of paper, scanned
into her computer, and attempted to make it look professional using Photoshop and Illustrator.  
She is pretty sure she's gonna go back and fix that, once she has some free time.
